Facial-keypoints-detection
====
# Introduction</br>
Detect human face's keypoints such as eyes,noise,mouth and so on by using CNN.<br/>
The training data 'training.csv' and The test data 'test.csv' can be downloaded on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data (Since they are too large to be uploaded).<br/>
The saved model is in 'facial data' but the main part is so large,too. So please use the training data to train the model by yourself.<br/>
# HOW TO USE</br>
Just run [the train pyfile](https://github.com/KaygoYM/Facial-keypoints-detection/blob/master/facial_keypoints.py) and [the test pyfile](https://github.com/KaygoYM/Facial-keypoints-detection/blob/master/facial_keypoints_test.py) is OK.</br>
</br>
AND,all the PATH in [the train pyfile](https://github.com/KaygoYM/Facial-keypoints-detection/blob/master/facial_keypoints.py) and [the test pyfile](https://github.com/KaygoYM/Facial-keypoints-detection/blob/master/facial_keypoints_test.py) should be rewritten (if necessary) when you run them.</br>
# Result</br>
The final result is shown just like [Figure_1](https://github.com/KaygoYM/Facial-keypoints-detection/blob/master/Figure_1.png)</br>
## Tips:</br>
[another test by using real photo.py](https://github.com/KaygoYM/Facial-keypoints-detection/blob/master/another%20test%20by%20using%20real%20photo.py) is the test file using your real daily selfies or photos for detection.</br>
